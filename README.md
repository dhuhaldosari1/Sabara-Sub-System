# Sabara System ✨

#Project Overview
Sabara System is a small personal project I developed to practice and prepare for my graduation project.  
It is an all-in-one healthy living app that helps simplify users’ health routines and daily organization.  
The app is inspired by the resilience of the cactus plant “Sabar” and the concept of patience “Alsaber.”  

This project was developed using Android Studio with Java.
